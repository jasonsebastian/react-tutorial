# ReactJS Documentation

This document is a bullet-point summary of the documentation for ReactJS.

## Introducing JSX
```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```
- This funny syntax is neither a string nor HTML. It is called JSX.
- JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript.
- JSX is used to describe what the UI should look like.
- JSX produces React "elements".

### Why JSX?
- React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic:
  - how events are handled,
  - how the state changes over time, and
  - how the data is prepared for display.

### Embedding Expressions in JSX
- Use a variable called `name` inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:
```js
const name = 'Jason';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
- You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX (e.g., `2 + 2`, `user.firstName`, or `formatName(user)`).
- Split JSX over multiple lines for readability to avoid the pitfalls of [automatic semicolon insertion](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2846283):
```js
const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
  </h1>
);
```

### JSX Is An Expression Too
- You can use JSX inside of `if` statements and `for` loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:
```js
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger</h1>;
}
```

### Specifying Attributes with JSX
- You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:
```js
const element = <div tabIndex="0"></div>;
```
- You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:
```js
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;
```
- Don't put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. Use either quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in the same attribute.

> **Warning:**
> 
> Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses `camelCase` property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.
> 
> For example, `class` becomes [`className`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className) in JSX, and `tabindex` becomes [`tabIndex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/tabIndex).

### Specifying Children with JSX
- If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with `/>`:
```js
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl} />;
```
- JSX tags may contain children:
```
const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
  </div>
);
```

### JSX Prevents Injection Attacks
- By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Hence it is safe to embed user input in JSX:
```js
const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
// This is safe:
const element = <h1>{title}</h1>;
```

### JSX Represents Objects
- Babel compiles JSX down to `React.createElement()` calls. These two examples are identical:
```js
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
```
```js
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```
- `React.createElement()` performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:
```js
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```
- These objects are called "React elements". React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.

## Rendering Elements
- An element describes what you want to see on the screen:
```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```
- Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and cheap to create.

### Rendering an Element into DOM
- Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node:
```html
<div id="root"></div>
```
- To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to [`ReactDOM.render()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render):
```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Updating the Rendered Element
- React elements are immutable.
- With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to [`ReactDOM.render()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render). Consider this ticking clock example, which calls [`ReactDOM.render()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render) every second from a [`setInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) callback:
```js
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```
> **Note:**
> 
> In practice, most React apps only call [`ReactDOM.render()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render) once. In the next sections we will learn how such code gets encapsulated into [stateful components](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html).

### React Only Updates What's Necessary
- React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

## Components and Props
- Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

### Function and Class Components
- The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:
```js
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
- This function accepts a single "props" object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components "function components" because they are literally JavaScript functions.
- You can also use an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) to define a component:
```js
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

### Rendering a Component
- Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:
```js
const element = <div />;
```
- However, elements can also represent user-defined components:
```js
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```
- When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object "props". For example, this code render "Hello, Sara" on the page:
```js
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
- Recap:
  1. We call `ReactDOM.render()` with the `<Welcome name="Sara" />` element.
  2. React calls the `Welcome` component with `{name: 'Sara'}` as the props.
  3. Our `Welcome` component returns a `<h1>Hello, Sara</h1>` element as the result.
  4. React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match `<h1>Hello, Sara</h1>`.

> **Note:** Always start component names with a capital letter.
> 
> React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, `<div />` represents an HTML div tag, but `<Welcome />` represents a component and requires `Welcome` to be in scope.

### Composing Components
- Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail.
```js
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Sara" />
      <Welcome name="Cahal" />
      <Welcome name="Edite" />
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
- Typically, new React apps have a single `App` component at the very top. However, if you integrate React into an existing app, you might start bottom-up with a small component like `Button` and gradually work your way to the top of the view hierarchy.

### Extracting Components
- Don't be afraid to split components into smaller components. Consider this `Comment` component:
```js
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
        <img className="Avatar"
          src={props.author.avatarUrl}
          alt={props.author.name}
        />
        <div className="UserInfo-name">
          {props.author.name}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
- This component can be tricky to change because of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse individual parts of it. Letâ€™s extract a few components from it. First, we will extract `Avatar`:
```js
function Avatar(props) {
  return (
    <img className="Avatar"
      src={props.user.avatarUrl}
      alt={props.user.name}
    />
  );
}
```
- We recommend naming props from the component's own point of view rather than the context in which it is being used. In this case, we have given its prop a more generic name: `user` rather than `author`.
- Now Comment becomes:
```js
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
        <Avatar user={props.author} />
        <div className="UserInfo-name">
          {props.author.name}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
- Next, we will extract a `UserInfo` component that renders an `Avatar` next to the user's name:
```js
function UserInfo(props) {
  return (
    <div className="UserInfo">
      <Avatar user={props.user} />
      <div className="UserInfo-name">
        {props.user.name}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
- This lets us simplify Comment even further:
```js
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <UserInfo user={props.author} />
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
- Having a paletter of reusable components pays off in larger apps despite of the seemingly grunt work at first. A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times (`Button`, `Panel`, `Avatar`), or is complex enough on its own (`App`, `FeedStory`, `Comment`), it is a good candidate to be extracted to a separate component.

### Props are Read-Only
- All React components must act like [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) with respect to their props. Pure functions do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.
- Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.

## State and Lifecycle
- Consider the ticking clock example from one of the previous sections.
```js
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(
    element,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```
- In this section, we will learn how to make the `Clock` component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will set up its own timer and update itself every second.
- We can start by encapsulating how the clock looks:
```js
function Clock(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

function tick() {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Clock date={new Date()} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```
- However, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the `Clock` sets up a time and updates the UI every second should be an implementation detail of the `Clock`.
- Ideally we want to write this once and have the `Clock` update itself:
```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
- To implement this, we need to add "state" to the `Clock` component.
- State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.

### Converting a Function to a Class
- You can convert a function component like `Clock` to a class in five steps:
  1. Create an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) with the same name, that extends `React.Component`.
  2. Add a single empty method to it called `render()`.
  3. Move the body of the function into the `render()` method.
  4. Replace `props` with `this.props` in the `render()` body.
  5. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.
```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    ); 
  }
}
```
- The `render` method will be called each time an update happens, but as long as we render `<Clock />` into the same DOM node, only a single instance of the `Clock` class will be used. This lets us use additional features such as local state and lifecycle methods.

### Adding Local State to a Class
We will move the `date` from props to state in three steps:
1. Replace `this.props.date` with `this.state.date` in the `render()` method:
```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    ); 
  }
}
```
2. Add a class constructor that assigns the initial `this.state` (Note: Class components should always call the base constructor with props.):
```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    ); 
  }
}
```
3. Remove the date prop from the `<Clock />` element:
```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
- We will later add the timer code back to the component itself. The result looks like this:
```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
### Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class
- In applications with many components, it's very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.
  - "Mounting": We want to [set up a timer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) whenever the `Clock` is rendered to the DOM for the first time.
  - "Unmounting": We also want to [clear that timer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/clearInterval) whenever the DOM produced by the `Clock` is removed.
-  We can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts:
```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
These methods are called "lifecycle methods".
- `componentDidMount()` method: runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM.
```js
componentDidMount() {
  this.timerID = setInterval(
    () => this.tick(),
    1000
  );
}
```
- Note how we save the timer ID right on `this` (`this.timerID`).
- You are free to add additional fields to the class manually if you need to store something that doesn't participate in the data flow (like a timer ID).
- We will tear down the timer in the `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method:
```js
componentWillUnmount() {
  clearInterval(this.timerID);
}
```
- Finally, we will implement a method called `tick()` that the `Clock` component will run every second. It will use `this.setState()` to schedule updates to the component local state:
```
tick() {
  this.setState({date: new Date()});
}
```
- Recap:
  1. When `<Clock />` is passed to `ReactDOM.render()`, React calls the constructor of the `Clock` component. Since `Clock` needs to display the current time, it initializes `this.state` with an object including the current time. We will later update this state.
  2. React then calls the `Clock` componentâ€™s `render()` method. This is how React learns what should be displayed on the screen. React then updates the DOM to match the `Clock`â€™s render output.
  3. When the `Clock` output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method. Inside it, the `Clock` component asks the browser to set up a timer to call the componentâ€™s `tick()` method once a second.
  4. Every second the browser calls the `tick()` method. Inside it, the `Clock` component schedules a UI update by calling `setState()` with an object containing the current time. Thanks to the `setState()` call, React knows the state has changed, and calls the `render()` method again to learn what should be on the screen. This time, `this.state.date` in the `render()` method will be different, and so the render output will include the updated time. React updates the DOM accordingly.
  5. If the `Clock` component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method so the timer is stopped.

### Using State Correctly
#### Do not modify state directly.
- For example, this will not re-render a component.
```js
// Wrong
this.state.comment = 'Hello';
```
- Instead, use `setState()`:
```js
// Correct
this.setState({comment: 'Hello'});
```
- The only place where you can assign `this.state` is the constructor.
#### State updates may be asynchronous.
- React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance.
- Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be update asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state. For example, this code may fail to update the counter:
```js
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
});
```
- To fix it, use a second form of `setState()` that accepts a function rather than an object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument:
```js
this.setState((state, props) => {
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
});
```
#### State updates are merged.
- When you call `setState()`, React merges the object you provide into the current state. For example, your state may contain several independent variables:
```js
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
    posts: [],
    comments: []
  };
}
```
- Then you can update them independently with separate `setState()` calls:
```js
componentDidMount() {
  fetchPosts().then(response => {
    this.setState({
      posts: response.posts
    });
  });
  fetchComments().then(response => {
    this.setState({
      comments: response.comments
    });
  });
}
```
- The merging is shallow, so `this.setState({comments})` leaves `this.state.posts` intact, but completely replaces `this.state.comments`.

### The Data Flows Down
- State is often called local or encapsulated. It is not accessible to any component other than the owns and sets it.
- A component may choose to pass its state down as props to its child components:
```js
<FormattedDate date={this.state.date} />
```
- This is commonly called a "top-down" or "unidirectional" data flow. Any state is always owned by some specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components "below" them in the tree.
- Imagine a component tree as a waterfall of props.
- In React, all components are truly isolated.
